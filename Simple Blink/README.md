# Simple Blink
Russell Binaco:
Simple Blink uses a for-loop delay to turn an LED on and off at a 50% duty cycle.
All five boards have implemented Simple Blink successfully.
The MSP430G2552 and FR5994 blink two LED's, whereas the other three boards blink one LED.

## Extra Work
### UART Control: Single Character
The MSP430G2553 implements UART to change between three speeds. Keyboard input '1', '2', and '3' are valid, and blink the LED at slow, medium, and fast rates respectively.
